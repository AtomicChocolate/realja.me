<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is realja.me. My website, and has a little bit of content at the moment.</p>
<p>I'm a programmer, supposedly.</p>
<p>Here, you'll find 3 separate blogs: a
  <a href="/blog">standard blog</a>,
  <a href="/devlog">devlogs</a>
  - project updates (currently inactive), and
  <a href="/dailynote">"daily notes"</a>
  - brief, frequent writing about stuff I've learned.</p>
<p>It's mainly informative content, but I want it to be personal. I wish to write about the things I enjoy in a way that'll make other people appreciate them.</p>
<p>This website is always slowly expanding. You can
  <a href="/contact">subscribe to the RSS feed and find me on social media</a>
  to stay up to date.</p>
<p>Thanks! - james</p>
