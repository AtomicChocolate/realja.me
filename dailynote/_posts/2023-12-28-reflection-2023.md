It's that time of year where people start to regret their decisions in the year, or lack thereof. How did this year go by so fast, they wonder? I'm in that boat too.
But some people are additionally able to look back on their year with pride, so let's reflect.

## I did things

## I didn't do things

## Conclusion

Let's do more in 2024. That's a motto.
