Here are some thoughts on the books I read at least a bit. (I've gotten a bit lazy on reading this week.) No weekly posting, I guess, but oh well.

## Letters to a Young Writer by Colum McCann (Non-Fiction / Literature)

This book's amazing, it feels like the author is giving you a heart-to-heart talk right now. "Young writer", he says over and over. About all sorts of things from as little as punctuation marks to coming up with characters or getting your book published.

I'm not exactly planning to be a writer or anything, but this book was amazing either way. I think it's a nice approach, to broaden your perspective and knowledge with stuff that's out of your comfort zone, or just not something you think of yourself as doing or knowing. It can inadvertently help you in terms of creativity, inspiration, problem solving, so I'm trying to read books of all genres, types, and sizes here.

Steve Jobs isn't my hero, but I remember reading something he said about that, which is what influenced me:

> ‚ÄúI decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to [learn calligraphy]. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful. Historical. Artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating. None of this had any hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never have multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.‚Äù

## Every Word is a Bird We Teach to Sing by Daniel Tammet (Non-Fiction / Language)

So, Daniel Tammet is a person who's fascinated me since I learned about him. Maybe a month ago, my Psychology class showed a video about him and his abilities, which include his feat of memorizing and recalling pi up to *22,500* digits?!

I found out he writes books, so I set out to read one. I chose this one randomly, and it's fascinating. It's a book about language, which Daniel has learned several of. Partially about unique details about how foreign languages, including several niche ones, express and structure things differently, but it's also about the experiences with that language told by speakers all around the world. It's not just about Daniel, he's travelled to a lot of places.

I don't even care about language that much! I mean... I think it's cool, but the way the author writes, describes things, tells a story, that's investing. I want to read more, because I really like his style.

## Dragon Haven by Robin Hobb (Fantasy)

This one was interesting because it turns out I stumbled into a gigantic series. This is the 2nd book in a series of 4 books... which itself, is a series containing 5 series of books - *Realm of the Elderlings*. **16** books and many more novellas and short stories!

I chose to continue reading this one, out of laziness, and read maybe 60 pages. It's OK, but for a book with "dragon" in the title I kinda wish there was more of a focus on... dragons? The description of the book seemed to focus on them! I like the worldbuilding aspects, but I'm not a fan of a ridiculous amount of worldbuilding that it gets in the way of a plot, or characters, and this book kinda felt like that. But again, I didn't read the 10-something books before this, so I'm not going to think negatively of it.

## This Mortal Coil by Emily Suvada (Science Fiction / Dystopian)

A friend recommended me this book! And it seems pretty decent! It has an interesting premise, at least from the first 100 or so pages I've read.

Post apocalyptic survival meets genetic technology. And the author knows her stuff, there's a lot of aspects to this book that only a programmer could write. It's still an accessible book for everyone, though. Hopefully it continues to be this good to the end, and to the next 2 books in the trilogy.

## Wool by Hugh Howey (Science Fiction)

I didn't get around to reading this book past the first page. But it seems interesting, and I'm trying to find good fiction books to read. ü§∑

## Next week

There were a bunch of other books I got from the library that I haven't read yet, and some I'm not planning to read. So I'll  look for some new books that catch my eye, and read some of the ones I have. Definitely, I'll give Wool a try, and finish This Mortal Coil.

I've never reviewed books before, but I just wanted to share what I've read and maybe you'll find one of them interesting.

Thanks for reading my blog!
