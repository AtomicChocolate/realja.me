After about a week of reading, these are my thoughts on the books I read at least a bit of.

## Letters to a Young Writer by Colum McCann (Non-Fiction / Literature)

## Every Word is a Bird We Teach to Sing by Daniel Tammet (Non-Fiction / Language)

So, Daniel Tammet is a person who's fascinated me since I learned about him. Maybe a month ago, my Psychology class showed a video about him and his abilities, which include his feat of memorizing and recalling pi up to *22,500* digits?!

I found out he writes books, so I set out to read one. I chose this one randomly, and it's fascinating. It's a book about language, which Daniel has learned several of. Partially about unique details about how foreign languages, including several niche ones, express and structure things differently, but it's also about the experiences with that language told by speakers all around the world. It's not just about Daniel, he's travelled to a lot of places.

I don't even care about language that much! I mean... I think it's cool, but the way the author writes, describes things, tells a story, that's investing. I want to read more, because I really like his style.

## Dragon Haven by Robin Hobb (Fantasy)

This one was interesting because it turns out I stumbled into a gigantic series. This is the 2nd book in a series of 4 books... which itself, is a series containing 5 series of books. 26 (?) books!

I chose to ignore this, out of laziness, and read maybe 60 pages. It's OK, but for a book with "dragon" in the title I kinda wish there was more of a focus on... dragons? The description of the book seemed to focus on them! I like the worldbuilding aspects, but I'm not a fan of a ridiculous amount of worldbuilding that it gets in the way of a plot, or characters, and this book kinda felt like that. But again, I didn't read the 10-something books before this, so I'm not going to think negatively of it.

## This Mortal Coil by Emily Suvada (Science Fiction)

A friend recommended me this book! And it is very good!

## Wool by Hugh Howey (Science Fiction)

I didn't get around to reading this book. But it seems interesting, and I'm trying to find good fiction books to read.

## Next week
