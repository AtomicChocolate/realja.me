## 404 not found

*Seems that nothing is here.*

...

You ever think about 404 pages?

They're designed to display the error to your web browser. That's true.

But think of it this way: 1 extra page that the webmaster has to write.

(Mostly.)

All those personal websites you thought you've seen the entirety of, have one secret page left.

Why not intentionally see what the 404 page has to offer, next time you visit?
