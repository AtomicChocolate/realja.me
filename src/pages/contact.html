<h2 class="header-band">My Button</h2>

<p>
    I have my own 88x31 gif button for this website! I would be humbled if you make use of it. If you do, please let me
    know, I'd love to see your site!
</p>

<p>
    The button is a scene I quickly created in the old Roblox engine. I might change the button often in the future,
    putting the "logo" in different maps and skyboxes - right now it's just a good old baseplate and default skybox.
</p>

<p>
    So on that note, if you put the button on your site, it might be a good idea for the image source to link directly
    to my site, instead of making a copy on your own server. So when I update it, your website will have the updated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    		design!</p>
