yeah, i have a ton of regret for not being able to see projects through completion.
in my life i always either have 0 motivation to do anything or i "hyperfocus" and basically spend whole days doing nothing but working on something.
right now, i guess i'm hyperfocusing on the site redesign.
but since like spring 2023 up to now, august, its been just non-stop executive dysfunction for the most part

that's why textarea.site rotted,
fxreddit never got past a really early prototype,
and any other possible projects didn't even get started.
i've spent all this time working on roblox games, like my entire high school life but i've only released 1. spooking out, which was due to my friend helping me that prevented it from rotting.

i hope getting back into the schedule of school and other stuff thats improving my life will allow me to be more productive.
we'll see.

these html comments are nice for letting me vent
i never talk about this stuff online

thank you for reading. i will persevere

    <p class="project-status">Complete! | September - November 2022</p>
    <p class="project-description">Spooking Out is a Halloween game made for 2010 Roblox by me and a friend. It's a simple arcade-style game about working together to catch ghosts in various maps. A simple game, but we had a lot of fun making it and playing it with the community on release :)<br>It was submitted for the Novetus Halloween game contest,
        <b>and we won!!!!!!! Our game is now bundled with Novetus as a default map.</b><br>I also ported it to modern Roblox, adding controller/Xbox/mobile support and badges.</p>

Great for taking quick notes.<br>It's fully working and stable, but I would like to go back and add more utility features such as importing text files, more themes, sharing your text, etc.</p>

    <p class="project-status">April - June 2023</p>
    <p class="project-description">This was planned to be a new game for the 2012 Roblox engine. Gameplay is divided into peaceful Stardew Valley inspired gameplay of farming, decorating your farm, etc. and part roguelike-style exploring wild forests to collect materials. Make money to level up your farm, and a whole lot more ideas and plans. However, the game suffered intense scope creep, and I got burned out from development (especially in the later 2 months) and shelved it. I'd still like to make it, though.</p>
