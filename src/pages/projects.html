<!--
yeah, i have a ton of regret for not being able to see projects through completion.
in my life i always either have 0 motivation to do anything or i "hyperfocus" and basically spend whole days doing nothing but working on something.
right now, i guess i'm hyperfocusing on the site redesign.
but since like spring 2023 up to now, august, its been just non-stop executive dysfunction for the most part

that's why textarea.site rotted,
fxreddit never got past a really early prototype,
and any other possible projects didn't even get started.
i've spent all this time working on roblox games, like my entire high school life but i've only released 1. spooking out, which was due to my friend helping me that prevented it from rotting.

i hope getting back into the schedule of school and other stuff thats improving my life will allow me to be more productive.
we'll see.

these html comments are nice for letting me vent
i never talk about this stuff online

thank you for reading. i will persevere
