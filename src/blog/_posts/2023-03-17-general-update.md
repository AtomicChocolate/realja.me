## Outline

- Website got a slight revamping: new background and colors, real tag filtering with the "Topics" tag cloud, `TODO note anything else I do`
- Welcome back btw
- I've been tired and lazy for months
- I'm working on getting back on track: sleeping at the right time, limiting social media usage and other distractions, reading books, etc.
- Sorry for never getting around to writing articles about the Roblox Wiki rehosting project or the Novetus Creative Team, also articles about my 2 failed past modern Roblox projects (all coming soon).
- I'd also like to write blog posts about other topics such as book reviews. Nothing too formal, just dumping my barely-organized thoughts on books I just finished reading. And lots of other sorts of writings too!
- I'm also working to further my web projects and create a brand new Novetus game.
- I'll write about the Novetus dev team in more depth of course, but just know we've been experimenting and planning ideas for the last few months. We've been going through a lot of ideas! 
- `Screenshot/footage of an early prototype for some Novetus game of ours here...`
- Hey, I got a CRT!

Hey there. It's been months since my last article, but I'm finally back. First, let's dive into what's changed around here.

## Website revamps

It looks a bit prettier now, don't it? I have a soft spot for websites with a tiled background, as long as it's pleasing. I'm still seeking a good one, so don't be frightened if it changes the next day you check this site.

The content of the website itself is a slight bit more colorful, with a bluish tint to the text, white borders, and a rounded black edge to the header (shamelessly copied from GNOME). The title now displays the title of the page, not just "realja.me". So that's nice!

Blog pages no longer use fancy symbols for quotes and ellipses. Nobody was complaining before, but I think this was a good idea so it's easier to copy and paste excerpts of my blog posts. What I mean basically, is that quotes now show up as `"` and not the pair of rounded quotes, `“` `”`. Single quotes too, `'` instead of `‘` `’`. And for ellipses, `...` (3 periods) instead of `…`.

The [home page](/) has some good old 88x31 buttons just above the footer at the bottom that link to my favorite sites. They're either my inspiration, invaluable resources for creating a website, or are just really cool all in all. [My buddy Nick64 has an awesome site, check that one out especially.](https://nick64.me)

And by the way... I MADE A BUTTON FOR THE SITE! `TODO TODO TODO`

Also, the [blog index page](/blog) has a "tag cloud", so you can filter by specific topics. I kinda had filtering before, but it was a lot more unwieldy to use. Plus, in the near future there will be many blog posts, so filtering might be actually helpful!

## Future blog posts?

I've been planning to write these blog posts for a very long time, but due to multiple reasons (mostly laziness) I never got around to it. No promises, but that should be changing now.

Here's the topics I guaranteed want to make into blog posts (I'll update them into links when they get written):

- Announcing the Old Roblox Wiki rehosting project [(link)](https://wiki.realja.me)
- The beginning of and being invited to the Novetus Creative Team (making old Roblox games "in-house" for the launcher as a small team)
- A modern Roblox project I spent a lot of time working on in 2021 but gave up on
- A 2nd failed project for modern Roblox that came before it
- My thoughts on something I've been thinking of acquiring for a while, it's mentioned in this article [if you want to spoil the surprise...?](#one-more-thing)

## Welcome back...

Okay, you might have been wondering why I've been inactive. I'm lazy, alright? Clean and simple. I've been growing content with sitting in my room, doing nothing, but just watching YouTube videos and scrolling Twitter, essentially. That's not the whole story, but the most important part is that I've been mostly inactive with things. Or even if I am making an effort, it's small, and barely productive. Life's been catching me by too; homework is piling up as we get closer to school ending, and family stuff (nothing bad, don't worry. Quite the opposite, in fact! Either way, it distracts me from what I need to do.)

What I'm saying is that I need to snap back and start being regularly productive. Nothing's going to fall into my lap and fix this for me. So I've been making small changes in my lifestyle to put me on a better trajectory. One thing is getting onto a normal sleep schedule. I always found myself having some work I want to do that makes me stay up way late; now, I get it done in the afternoon instead of wasting that time scrolling the internet.

I also am reducing screen time usage on my phone, and the biggest thing is keeping my phone in a different room when I go to sleep, so I don't immediately pull it out when I wake up.

Last thing is going on a short walk daily on my free days off to take breaks from looking at screens, and reading books as well. I might post book reviews, basically just my thoughts on books right after finishing it (with no background knowledge on the book or how it was reviewed/critiqued by others). I've found some interesting books at the library and various thrift stores.

## My "To-Develop" List

Because I'm sure you liked the first list of promised blog posts so much, enjoy another list of all the stuff I'm currently developing or plan to develop.

- This website! My work is never done with writing blog posts and new pages, as well as revamping and theming it further.
- [Improving and extending the Old Roblox Wiki](https://wiki.realja.me)
- [fxreddit: like fxtwitter, for Reddit videos!](https://github.com/real-jame/fxreddit)
- [textarea.site](https://textarea.site)
- A new game for old Roblox

## The next old Roblox game

I was invited to the Novetus Creative Team back when it was started in December 2022. Since then, we have published 0 games and made no announcements for planned projects.

...

That doesn't mean we're not trying! We're just in something of a drought in terms of plans and game ideas. I don't want to be self-centered because other people have been doing great work, but I myself was working on a handful of prototypes throughout the months. Just a few days ago, I got a really cool idea.

I don't want to spoil it too much currently, but this random video from almost a year ago might sum up the vibes of the game:

## One more thing

I got a CRT monitor a few days ago.

`IMAGE HERE TODO`

I'm a "zoomer" born in the mid 2000s, so CRTs were already on their way out when I was growing up. I haven't seen a CRT screen powered on in a while, honestly...

I've been interested in getting one for a while, just to try it out and see. Finally, I decided to do it. So I got this one off Facebook Marketplace.

As promised earlier, I'll write a blog post about it soon, but in short: did I "fall for a meme"? Yup. I'm definitely not getting rid of it though, for a few reasons I'll write in the article.

## Conclusion

Not only am I sorry to people following me and reading these posts for this inactivity, I want to apologize to myself, for failing to be productive for so long. Metaphorically speaking, I vow to wake up and start moving again. That is the mantra I want to follow.

That's all I have for now. Thank you so much for reading!
