Today is December 26, 2022. My Roblox account is now 11 years old.

Christmas 2011, I was young. One of my gifts that year was a computer, a hand-me-down from my dad.
The day after, we were looking for a game that I could play.
After searching the internet, we stumbled across "Roblox", a building game.

> Free Games and Building Games! A virtual world for kids with user-created castles, cars, spaceships, swords, battles, trucks, zombies and awesome destruction. Build, battle, chat, or just hang out online.

I played Roblox almost every day for the next 6 years. Could you imagine that 11 years later, I would be a developer for the very thing?

In October, I teamed up with my great friend Tobu.fi to make something for Novetus. That something became [Spooking Out]({% post_url 2022-10-24-introducing-spooking-out %}). We took a break afterwards, and worked on our own projects and lives.

**We are now ready for our next game.**

Scroll down, and see.

Sorry for not having more to show. We are working hard, but our project is still in its early phases.
We hope we are able to breathe new life into a classic platform, and give you something to enjoy!

Tobu.fi wrote something for this blog post, so I will conclude with it:
