Today is December 26, 2022. My Roblox account is now 11 years old.

Christmas 2011, I was young. One of my gifts that year was a computer, a hand-me-down from my dad.
The day after, we were looking for a game that I could play. A free game that's good for kids.
After searching the internet, we stumbled across "Roblox", a building game.

> Free Games and Building Games! A virtual world for kids with user-created castles, cars, spaceships, swords, battles, trucks, zombies and awesome destruction. Build, battle, chat, or just hang out online.

He made an account for me, and I started playing. I was hooked! I played it almost every day, when I came home from school, I would get on Roblox.
This happened for about the next 6 years, up until around 2017.

Returning to the world of classic Roblox through various revival projects, it's still great!
A lot of things, you love when you're a kid, but realize how bad it is when you revisit it after having matured.
Roblox, however, is not this.

There's still a lot of fun in playing in these blocky landscapes and open-ended sandbox environments. The wacky physics. The multiplayer collaboration, or competition. The creativity. The unique gameplay in every map. And so much more.

I started learning how to develop for classic Roblox a year or 2 ago, and all of my projects were too large in scope to ever release.
When the revivals all fizzled out in 2022, I moved my attention to other efforts, mainly learning web and modern Roblox development.

But, I was still there. Always thinking about what I could make next.

Thanks to the excellent Novetus project, allowing decentralized old Roblox developing, playing, and server hosting, we don't need to rely on revivals.

I decided to team up with my excellent friend Tobu.fi, another creator of various things, to make _something_ for Novetus. That something eventually turned into a game, [Spooking Out]({% post_url 2022-10-24-introducing-spooking-out %}).

It was super fun working with him, and I wanted to make a bunch more stuff! But in the end, we were a bit tired, and took a break for almost 2 months.

**We are now ready for our next game.**

**Here is your teaser!**

Sorry for not having more to show. We are working hard, but our project is still in its early phases.
We hope we are able to breathe more new life into old Roblox, and give you something to enjoy!

Tobu.fi wrote something for this blog post, so I will conclude with it:

> We both have many hopes for what can be done. What will be done is only a fraction of a fraction of that.
> Life gets in the way. But, just for a moment, we're here. And that is beautiful.
