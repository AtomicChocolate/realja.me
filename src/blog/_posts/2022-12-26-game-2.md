Today is December 26, 2022. My Roblox account is now 11 years old.

Christmas 2011, I was young. One of my gifts that year was a computer, a hand-me-down from my dad.
The day after, we were looking for a game that I could play.
After searching the internet, we stumbled across "Roblox", a building game.

> Free Games and Building Games! A virtual world for kids with user-created castles, cars, spaceships, swords, battles, trucks, zombies and awesome destruction. Build, battle, chat, or just hang out online.

I was hooked! For the next 6 years, I would get on Roblox immediately after getting home from school.
A few years ago, I rediscovered old Roblox with the help of various projects.

There are many things that you love as a kid, but find out is bad when you revisit it with maturity. Roblox is not one of those things.

Lots of things happened in this revival community over the years, but I held on.
I began to return a few months ago, after realizing the potential of the Novetus launcher for decentralized play of old Roblox maps.

I decided to team up with my excellent friend Tobu.fi, another creator of various things, to make something for Novetus. That something eventually turned into a game, [Spooking Out]({% post_url 2022-10-24-introducing-spooking-out %}).

It was super fun working with him, and I wanted to make a bunch more stuff! But in the end, we were a bit tired, and took a break for almost 2 months.

**We are now ready for our next game.**

**Here is your teaser!**

Sorry for not having more to show. We are working hard, but our project is still in its early phases.
We hope we are able to breathe new life into old Roblox, and give you something to enjoy!

Tobu.fi wrote something for this blog post, so I will conclude with it:
