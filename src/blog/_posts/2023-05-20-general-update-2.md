Welcome to the 2nd [General Update]({% post_url /blog/2023-03-31-general-update %}). These "general update" posts are shamelessly inspired by this cool website called [Cozynet](https://cozynet.org), feel free to check it out.
It's been almost a month since I've spoken here. In fact, it's May! My friend Nick has [written an article](https://nick64.me/netlogs/2023/05/first-post-of-may-status-update/) for his personal updates to mark the start of a new month, so you should read that too. He's dealing with stuff like money, college, and lots of personal projects... just like me.

## Devlogs

The website now mirrors, or archives, the teaser/announcement posts I make on Twitter and Mastodon about what I'm working on.
I bet that it would be annoying to scroll through my whole Twitter account, through all my random meme posts and other stuff in order to reach the occasional important thing.
So, now it's here too, so hopefully this site can help act as a sort of "portfolio" of my work. I mean, I already have the quick links section on the home page.

[Click here to view all the devlogs!](/tags/devlogs)


The devlogs are short, usually just an image or maybe a video, and a description. Future devlog posts will probably have some additional information not contained in the tweet. For the devlogs, you'll see old Roblox games, websites, just whatever I'm working on really.

By the way, the News and Devlogs section currently are in the same pool as standard blog posts. Hopefully you aren't too annoyed that I'm separating these articles if you use an RSS feeder... no one has complained about that yet, so I'll leave it as-is. Cuz I'm lazy.

## New project: Farming game

I've been working on this project recently (very, very slowly).

It's a new game for classic Roblox! It's kind of like Stardew Valley at first glance, but a lot has been changed, removed, or added to make this game feel right at home with classic Roblox.

### Stay tuned

There's also an ongoing update thread in the [Roblox Client Search Discord server](https://discord.gg/CHFK7eXXMY), so check that out too. ([direct thread link](https://discord.com/channels/313349637870190592/1105872338785927278/1105872338785927278))

## Personal

I don't want to get too in details about my personal life, but things are going OK. I still have a lot of ideas and plans to better myself for the rest of the year.

I haven't been totally following my plans from the previous general update but I've still been gradually getting better at life and stuff.

School's almost out, so for the summer I'll be working to remain mindful. Keep myself on track and orderly without school's rigid schedule, y'know?

One thing that may also help me... is a **job**.

### I got an internship!

It's a month-long (paid) IT internship at a health company! I got it through my school, and I'm really glad.

Since the start of this year I've been pressuring myself, maybe a bit too much, to get a good job. It feels like a weight's been lifted off my chest.

## Last update's article ideas

> Here's the topics I guaranteed want to make into blog posts (I'll update them into links when they get written):

> - Announcing the Old Roblox Wiki rehosting project
- The beginning of and being invited to the Novetus Creative Team (making old Roblox games "in-house" for the launcher as a small team)
- A modern Roblox project I spent a lot of time working on in 2021 but gave up on
- A 2nd failed project for modern Roblox that came before it
- My thoughts on something I've been thinking of acquiring for a while, it's mentioned in this article (if you want to spoil the surprise...?)
- Can a YouTube channel and a blog coexist?
- Making a ChatGPT plugin for old Roblox: because Roblox is putting AI in modern Studio, two can play at that game :troll: (mastodon alt)
- Modding a USB-C port onto a Nintendo DSi

So far, I have done NONE of these. Sorry. Most I still want to do, but others I've considered unnecessary.

### Roblox Legacy Docs

AKA the Old Roblox Wiki in the original article, but I renamed it since then. [You can find it here.](https://wiki.realja.me)

I'm not going to make an announcement article. It's already been announced, a long time ago! Now that devlogs are here, you can access the original announcement post easily.

For those who don't know about it, Roblox Legacy Documentation is a useful resource for people making Roblox games on old clients in the modern day, like I am. It could also be used simply for people who want to see what the Roblox engine and community was like back in the day.

The wiki is built off an archive of the Roblox Wiki from June 2012, but we've been doing a lot of work to make it more helpful. 

After all, website documentation isn't really necessary anymore, right?

<!-- TODO IMG of the archived section with caption "Don't worry, they've been preserved." -->

I do want to make articles about the project though. Like how I started it in the first place, not knowing anything about MediaWiki (the server software used). Or our progress, including a newfound interest in April.

### The CRT monitor

AKA "my thoughts on something" etc. in the original article, I didn't use the real name for a surprise.

![](/blog/media/TODO.png)
<!-- TODO img of my whole setup w/ 3 monitors here -->

The CRT monitor is pretty cool. I like it!

I'm using it as an extra monitor for my computer setup, so now I have 3.

Due to the small resolution, I find it useful mainly for displaying some information such as a terminal window while I am working.

#### Problems

However, it has a really strange issue with color on the edges. Degaussing, both through monitor options and rubbing a strong magnet over it hasn't done anything to help.

Maybe I'll try to manually degauss it in the future... either way, I do like it.

And hey, owning it and presenting it makes it seem like I'm credible. It's like having bookshelves in the background of your camera. Makes you look smart.

## New article ideas

- Renewing the life of an unused Android tablet by flashing LineageOS (and also: why I hate XDA Developers as a source of information)
- Why do I have a NeoCities banner if I'm not using it myself?
- Should new Novetus games be ported (fixing scripts, etc.) to modern Roblox? On that note, what about porting famous classic places? Is that even ethical?

**Expect the Android tablet article within a few days.**

## That's all

That's pretty much how things have been.
