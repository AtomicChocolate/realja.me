It's been a while since I've made a devlog post! This post is the **first** time I really talk about my new game on my website, and I'm basically just linking the gameplay video.

Micrathena is a new game for 2009L I've spent a few weeks on so far, and it's 99% done to the Alpha 1 release. Enjoy this video showing it off!

Essentially, the game is a round-based team PvP game that uses tactical gameplay - you might also think of it kinda like chess. And, there's minigames every few turns. It's a bit chaotic, but there's still strategy to be found!
